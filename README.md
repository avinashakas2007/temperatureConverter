# Temperature Converter

This is a **Temperature Converter** web app where users can input temperature values in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. The app dynamically converts the temperature values into the other units and displays them on the page.

Additionally, GIF images are displayed based on the temperature values:
- **Cold**: Displays a cold-related GIF.
- **Hot**: Displays a hot-related GIF.
- **Moderate**: Displays a moderate-related GIF.

## Features

- **Input Fields**: Users can enter values in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, and the app will automatically calculate the other temperature units.
- **Temperature-based GIFs**: The app displays a related GIF depending on whether the temperature is hot, cold, or moderate.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The app uses a simple and responsive layout with easy-to-use input fields.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage and providing a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic behind temperature conversions and dynamic content (GIFs).
- **jQuery**: For simpler DOM manipulation and updating the GIFs dynamically.
